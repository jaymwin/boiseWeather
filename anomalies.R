# Daily anomalies were the difference of each daily minimum temperature from a daily ‘base’ 
# value (Caesar et al. 2006). Daily ‘base’ minimum temperatures were calculated for each climate 
# station’s minimum temperature records from 1961 to 1990 using a five-day window centered on 
# each day (Caesar et al. 2006). 

# Nov - Feb

# Finally, we used daily minimum temperature
# anomaly data from the HadGHCND station nearest the
# southwestern Idaho kestrel population to examine changes
# in winter and spring minimum temperatures from 1987 to
# 2009. Spring months were defined as March and April 

# 1) five-day window
# 2) daily means 1961 to 1990 (is this 30 years?)
